# Nuclear species tree

The entire pipeline moving from SNP data to locus alignments, to gene trees estimated in iqtree, to species trees estimated in ASTRAL and concordance factors estimated in iqtree is available to view at: https://devonderaad.github.io/todiramphus.radseq/species.trees/astral.single.tip/SNPs.to.species.tree.workflow.single.tip.html

Sequence alignment data used to generate input gene trees for ASTRAL is named 'populations.all.phylip'.
