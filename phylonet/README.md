'1.nex' and '2.nex' are the 1 reticulation and 2 reticulation phylonet input files, respectively. 'run.bimcmc.sh' and 'run.2retic.sh' are slurm submit scripts to run each of these analyses remotely on the KU cluster. 'slurm-36694358.out' shows the results of the 2 reticulation run which failed to converge. 'slurm-36694359.out' and 'slurm-36697983.out' show two replicate runs of the 1 reticulation network, each of which converged on the same topology indicating good mixing of the MCMC sampler.
