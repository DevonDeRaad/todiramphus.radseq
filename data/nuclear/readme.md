Data in this directory:
- Raw, unfiltered SNP dataset containing all 100 individual samples and 222,393 SNPs is named 'populations.snps.vcf.gz'
- Filtered SNP dataset set at an 85% per-SNP completeness threshold, containing 83 samples and 7,430 SNPs on 1,892 loci, is named 'todi.85.vcf.gz'. This dataset was used as input for SplitsTree4 (Fig. 2A), StAMPP (pairwise heatmap; Fig. 4B), Dsuite (Fig. 6A),
- Filtered unlinked (> 100 bp apart in the genome) SNP dataset set at an 85% per-SNP completeness threshold, containing 83 samples and 1,892 SNPs on 1,892 loci, is named 'todi.unlinked.85.vcf.gz'. This dataset was used as input for TreeMix (Fig. 6B).
