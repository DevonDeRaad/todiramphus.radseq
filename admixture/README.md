# ADMIXTURE details

https://devonderaad.github.io/todiramphus.radseq/admixture/prep.vis.admixture.html shows the trials and tribulations of running ADMIXTURE on this dataset. We had issues with hierarchical structure and what appeared to be issues with including taxa where the levels of standing diversity were very different. Ultimately, removing the outgroup (T. leucopygius) and then removing T. sanctus, and then running pairwise comparisons with T. sanctus allowed us to present results we feel are transparent and reflective of these difficulties, while still maximizing the biological signal and not muddying the paper with technical error from violated assumptions. These iterations can be viewed here:  https://devonderaad.github.io/todiramphus.radseq/admixture/admixture.subsets.html All of the raw output and the input files used for these runs are available in the directories 'no.leuco', 'nosanctus', 'san.sord', 'san.tris', and 'san.saur'.
