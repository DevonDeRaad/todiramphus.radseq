# ADMIXTURE details

https://devonderaad.github.io/todiramphus.radseq/admixture/prep.vis.admixture.html shows the trials and tribulations of running ADMIXTURE on this dataset. We had issues with hierarchical structure and what appeared to be issues with including taxa where the levels of standing diversity were very different. Ultimately, removing the outgroup (T. leucopygius) and downsampling T. sanctus to a similar sample size as all of the other taxa allowed us to generate some reasonably consistent, robust results that made sense. https://devonderaad.github.io/todiramphus.radseq/admixture/admixture.for.revision.html shows the run that ultimately ended up going into the paper. All of the raw output and the input files used for this run are available in the directory 'admixture.output'.
